Ed's Diner:  Authentic American BBQ in Taiwan?  

Located in the Zhongshan district you immediately get the feeling you've stepped out of Taipei.  The architecture is newer and the space is much more open than other parts of Taipei.  As you come upon Ed's Diner, the first thing you notice is classic Americana of the 'dineresque' checked patterned sign and the blue awning outside.  The decor is nice, but it does give you the feeling that it's trying a little too hard to remind you classic American dining.  Nevertheless, in a foreign land one must never underestimate the power of nostalgia and the warmth it brings to the traveler's heart.  null
