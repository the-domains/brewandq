Ed's Diner:  Authentic American BBQ in Taiwan?  

Located in the Zhongshan district you immediately get the feeling you've stepped out of Taipei.  The architecture is newer and the space is much more open than other parts of Taipei.  As you come upon Ed's Diner, the first thing you notice is the classic Americana of the 'dineresque' checked patterned sign and the blue awning outside.  The decor is nice, but it does give you the feeling that it's trying a little too hard to remind you classic American dining.  Nevertheless, in a foreign land one must never underestimate the power of nostalgia and the warmth it brings to the traveler's heart.  

As a native of Kansas City I grew up with BBQ.  Because of this, I tend to be a bit of a BBQ snob.  I lived in Taiwan for 8 years and during that time I have not found truly authentic American BBQ.  I'm talking about delicious meats that have been rubbed and cooked low and slow.  So when I heard about Ed's Diner, I knew I had to check it out.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a2febd9a-1170-4a59-9ad2-347e74ca1ece.jpg)

When you sit down and take a look at the menu you immediately get excited by the offerings.  Ed serves beef brisket, pork ribs, pulled pork, and smoked chicken.  It's hard to decide and it would be great if Ed's had a sampler platter with a little taste of each thing.  I settled on the brisket sandwich and sweet potato side while my lovely wife got the ribs.  I went with the sandwich because the picture of the brisket showed one solitary slice of brisket on the plate and I was hankering for BBQ and wasn't convinced that my cravings would be satiated.  

I would later find out that the brisket slice is a generous portion, as is all of Ed's meals.  Your meal comes with a side and a starter salad with a delicious salsa verde dressing.  It's got a bit of spice to it, but nothing that's going to upset you. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/09f14b24-2953-48ae-947a-1fc9b681f386.jpg)

The Brisket had a delicious beef flavor to it.  As beef is hard to find in Taiwan, I was excited to munch on this beefy goodness.  The biggest let down on the brisket was the lack of bark on the outside and non-existence of any smoke ring on the meat.  For a restaurant claiming to cook 'low and slow' you expect to be greeted with a delicious pink smoke ring on your meat.  But overall, the beef was tender, juicy, and delicious (even if it did lack smoke).  

Taiwan has pork.  I mean sweet delicious piggies that you love to cook up and eat.  I'm not 100% sure why it is, but Taiwan's pork is simply delicious.  So I had high hopes for the pork ribs.
